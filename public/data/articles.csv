Responsible Computing for Computer Science Education in Kenya,Chao Mbogho, The Berkman Klein Center,"Skills in responsible and ethical computing are crucial for Kenyan educators to prepare the next generation of computer scientists who will solve the region's most pressing socio-economic issues. This talk will explore the growing and thriving landscape of Kenya's higher education and tech ecosystem by highlighting the gaps, opportunities, and social implications of responsible computing within the Kenyan context. With specific examples of how responsible innovation has been used to nurture employability and innovation among Kenyan tech students, this talk will showcase the impact of empowering students with holistic thinking and learning. The audience will also learn about the inaugural Responsible Computing Challenge in Kenya by Mozilla Foundation and what is envisioned over the next year and beyond.",https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/responsible-computing-computer-science-education-kenya,4/4/23,,Event
Ashoka University launches Civinc portal at Nanjangud,The Times of India,The Times of India," Ashoka University, Haryana, has launched Civinc, a first-of-its-kind mobile application and online portal that brings together on one platform information and contact details of elected representatives of municipalities and municipal employees.

The objective is to improve civic engagement by replacing opaque grievance portals with transparent communication channels linking residents and civic body functionaries.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/ashoka-university-launches-civinc-portal-at-nanjangud/articleshow/124811966.cms,10/26/25,,News

"Algorithmic Bias, Marketplaces, and Diversity Regulation",Lance (Yong) Park - Howard University,TPRC2024,"This study examines the posited relationship between diversity and the supply of debiased AI, using a cross-sectional survey sample of AI professionals working in Silicon Valley. The results of preliminary analyses show that increased diversity, when indicated by value diversity as opposed to demographic diversity, had a significant effect on decreased AI bias. Further, the analysis found that there was no significant difference in manufactured AI bias or the effort to debias AI attributable to the socio-demographic diversity alone, as self-reported by AI industry insiders. The study concludes with a call for much closer attention 1) to diversity in its conceptual and regulatory operationalization and 2) to conditional institutional variables in translating diversity into discernible effects. The author of this study emphasizes a preliminary nature of the findings, with suggestions for the potential areas of improvement in the future AI debate.

Embracing the AI in International Aid,Shachee Doshi and Christopher Burns,AI Business,"USAID is also investing in projects that not only build AI tools for specific problems but also tackle AIs underlying challenges. Through the Equitable AI Challenge, we funded projects to identify and address gender inequity resulting from AI tools in hiring, credit scoring and education. Partnering with Mozilla Foundation, we launched Responsible Computing Challenges in South Asia and Africa to shift the training of future AI technologists to better account for social, ethical and cultural contexts in which their products will work. We are developing a research and learning agenda across sectors Ð in agriculture we are exploring alternative models for data governance and the role AI can play in inclusively advancing agri-food systems or assessing the AI landscape in certain countries. In humanitarian assistance, we are exploring the use of AI for conducting needs analysis. And in media literacy, we are using AI to detect image and video alterations on social media.",https://aibusiness.com/responsible-ai/embracing-the-ai-in-international-aid,11/15/24,,News
"AI Early Warning for Disease, Famine at Risk in USAID Tear-Down",Kaustuv Basu ,Bloomberg Law,"In another canceled program, USAID was working with Mozilla to promote responsible computing in Kenya, South Africa, and other nations, offering future AI specialists in these countries a way to build technologies for good, said the agency employee.

The cuts in the Mozilla program put $1.8 million of federal funding at risk, said Steve Azeka, who leads the responsible computing challenge program for the Mozilla Foundation. The program has helped over 30,000 students in the US and abroad, but plans to expand it to Colombia and Ghana could be affected, he said in an email.

 Trump Administration Bars NPS from Reporting Visitor Data ,Robert Chaney,Mountain Journal,"""I'm so shocked to see it happening,"" said Melanie Walsh, an assistant professor at the University of Washington's Information School who teaches in the Responsible Datasets in Context project. ""Collecting data is powerful, even when it's approximate and imperfect. Visitation data demonstrates how many people love national parks and use national parks. It's a way to advocate for communities we love and want to protect. Apparently, the Trump administration doesnt want people to know how much engagement citizens have with national parks.""",https://mountainjournal.org/trump-administration-bars-national-park-service-from-reporting-visitation-data/,1-Apr-25,,News
Broadening Human-Centered Design: Developing and Implementing an African-Informed Approach to Global Technology Development,Susan Wyche - Michigan State University,University of Notre Dame,"

Human-centered design (HCD) and global development courses often ask students to design technologies for the Global South. Yet these courses frequently reinforce narratives that depict Africans as passive users rather than innovators, while overlooking the lived expertise of people on the continent. The result is an incomplete understanding of global technology use and design.",https://cse.nd.edu/events/broadening-human-centered-design-developing-and-implementing-an-african-informed-approach-to-global-technology-development/,18-Sep-25,,Event
